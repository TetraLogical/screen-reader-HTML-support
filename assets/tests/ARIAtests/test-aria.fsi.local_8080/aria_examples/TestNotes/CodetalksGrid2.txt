Use the arrow keys to move from cell to cell.
JAWS should read column headers as you move left and right.
Use home and end to move to the beginning and end of rows.
Use ctrl home and end to move to the beginning and end of the table.
Note: Although the example says the grid is selectable, I found no evidence that selection properties are exposed to jaws.
