JAWS does not treat the assertive and polite live regions quite as described by the text on the page. JAWS puts polite live updates into a queue and all polite messages are read when jaws is not speaking or is finished speaking. Assertive messages go to the top of the queue and clear the queue of polite messages, but do not interrupt the currently speaking text. Assertive messages also do not get interspersed with text during a say all, in between sentences for example.
