Press each one of the buttons in the example. When pressed, each button should create an alert and jaws should announce the alert's contents.
For the alerts which say "set focus", the position in the jaws virtual buffer should change to the text of the alert.
Press the "close" link to remove the alert after each test. 
Note: One problem with this example is that the alert element contains a link. Since alerts are not required to receive focus, content authors SHOULD NOT require users to close an alert. In this instance, the alertdialog role should have been used to create a dialog containing the alert text and link.
