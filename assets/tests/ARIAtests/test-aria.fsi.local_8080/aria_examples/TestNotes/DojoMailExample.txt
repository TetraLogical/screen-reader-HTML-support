To see an example of an aria dialog, tab to the toolbar, then arrow to the options button and press space bar.
In order to use the list of messages grid, you must tab to it. Setting focus from the virtual buffer will not produce the desired result. Note: all you can really do in the grid is to arrow around and hear the header information for each item.
