<p>
Summary: The region is marked as polite with aria-relevant="removals", therefore the removals should be announced after users have completed their current activity. Since additions and text changes are not specified, insertions and text changes should not be announced.</p>
<p>
Description of the expected behavior: After presenting the heading, the user agent should present the text in the live region area at the time. It should then proceed to the "Summary" section followed by the "Description of expected behavior" section. It should then continue to read the filler text until the end of the document and stop. Since there is no more user activity at this point, the removals from the live region area should be announced. In addition, if the user were reading and stopping intermittently, then when the user is idling, the removals from the live region area should be announced. However, since additions and text changes are not relevant, they should not be announced.
</p>
<p>
The filler text is here to let developers run their user agents for a longer period of time to make sure that everything will continue to behave as it should.
