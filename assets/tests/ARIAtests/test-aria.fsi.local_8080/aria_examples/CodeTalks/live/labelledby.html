Summary: The live region is labelled by the span element after it. The user agent should present this association to the user in some manner. Labels are intended to be short; if web developers intend to describe the live region, describedby=[idlist] should be used instead.
</p>
<p>
Description of the expected behavior: After presenting the heading, the user agent should present the text in the live region area at the time, followed by the span that labels the live region. It should then proceed to the "Summary" section followed by the "Description of expected behavior" section. It should then continue to read the filler text until the end of the document and stop. Since there is no more user activity at this point, the current text in the live region area should be announced. In addition, if the user were reading and stopping intermittently, then when the user is idling, the current text in the live region area should be announced. The association between the live region and its label should be presented to the user; one suggestion would be to allow users to query a live region for associated labels.

The filler text is here to let developers run their user agents for a longer period of time to make sure that everything will continue to behave as it should.
